## Overview

The `clustering.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the following:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and scaling the data for clustering analysis.
   - Visualizing the data to better understand its structure and distribution.

2. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - **K-Means Clustering**: The notebook applies K-Means to segment the data into distinct clusters based on similarity.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: The notebook also applies hierarchical clustering to provide another approach for clustering the data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - After clustering the data, various visualizations (like scatter plots and dendrograms) are used to illustrate the results and compare the performance of different clustering algorithms.

## Project Setup

To set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Toancodewell/cluster_project.git
   cd cluster_project
## Usage
1. Once you run the clustering.ipynb notebook, the steps will guide you through the following processes:
- Data preprocessing (such as scaling and cleaning).
- Applying clustering algorithms (like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering).
- Visualizing and comparing the clustering results.
2. **Clustering Algorithms**:
  1. K-Means Clustering
    - K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into k clusters based on feature similarity.
    - The notebook uses K-Means to segment data points into k distinct groups.
  2. Hierarchical Clustering
     - Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram) to show the nested grouping of data points.
    - The notebook applies this method and visualizes the dendrogram to better understand the relationships between clusters.
## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
